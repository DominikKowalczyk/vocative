# Developer Guidelines for Vocative and Open-Source PHP Library

## General Principles

- Adhere to the PHP Framework Interop Group (FIG) recommendations, particularly PSR-1, PSR-12, PSR-4, and PER Coding Style for coding standards.
- Ensure your code follows a consistent style, which can be enforced using tools like PHP_CodeSniffer, PHP Coding Standards Fixer, or PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer.
- For more details please read our style guidelines. Please ensure that your code adheres to our [Coding Style Guidelines](./CODE-STYLE.md).


## Version Control

- Use Git for version control and host your repository on GitHub for collaboration and contributions.
- Keep a clean commit history and use meaningful commit messages.

## Dependency Management

- Utilize Composer for managing dependencies and autoloading your library.
- Ensure your `composer.json` file is correctly configured, specifying autoload settings and dependencies.

## Release and Versioning

- Follow Semantic Versioning for your releases.
- Use Git tags to mark release points in your version history.

## Documentation

- Write clear and comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions, usage examples, and API references.
- Keep the documentation up-to-date with the latest version of your library.

## Testing

- Implement unit tests and integration tests using a testing framework like PHPUnit.
- Run tests regularly to catch issues early.

## Continuous Integration

- Set up continuous integration using services like Travis CI or GitHub Actions.
- Automate the running of tests and checks upon each commit or pull request.

## Deployment

- Use automated deployment tools to streamline the release process.
- Configure tagging in your VCS to trigger automatic deployments through services like Packagist.

## Community and Collaboration

- Define clear contribution guidelines, including coding standards, pull request procedures, and issue reporting.
- Respond promptly to issues and pull requests to foster a collaborative environment.
- Promote discussions around your library within the PHP community.

## Licensing

- Choose an appropriate open-source license for your project, such as the MIT License, which allows others to freely use, modify, and distribute your software.

## Security

- Ensure your library is secure by following the principles of code-data separation and input validation [1].
- Be aware of common security vulnerabilities and apply best practices to mitigate them.

## Maintenance

- Regularly update your library to address security vulnerabilities and bugs.
- Be responsive to feedback from the community and make improvements as needed.

By following these guidelines, you can create a robust, maintainable, and contributor-friendly open-source PHP library.
